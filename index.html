                                I'm fascinated by doors, espeically in other countries, 
                                where the lives being lived on the other side of the doors is likely to be very different than my own. 
                                This page features doors I loved enough to photograph in China and India.
                                </br></br>
                                I also adore elephants. I was lucky enough to get to see keepers bathing their elephant charges up close at
                                <bdi> <a href=https://www.keralatourism.org/kerala-article/2012/kottur-elephant-rehabilitation-centre/170 target="_blank">Kappukadu Elephant Rehabilitation Centre</bdi></a>
                                while I was in India. There was definite love between the keepers and the elephants, and the joy that the elephants clearly felt at
                                playing in the Neyyar river wasa wonderful to see.    
                                </br></br> 
                                And as for puns, they make the world a better place. Or at least a punnier place.
